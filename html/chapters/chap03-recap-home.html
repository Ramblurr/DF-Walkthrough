<p>In this tutorial we’ll set up some more living space for our dwarves as
well as more workshops and stockpiles. This will just be a short one as
I’m going to give you some tasks to do on your own at the end. Are you
up to the challenge?! Lets do it!</p>
<div class="section" id="recap-time">
<h2>3.1. Recap time<a class="headerlink" href="#recap-time" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We’ve covered quite a lot so far, and if you’ve played through, and
you’re still reading, you’re well on your way to being a master of
Dwarf Fortress. Lets look at what we’ve learned:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>How to look around and work out what you’re looking at.</li>
<li>How to dig out space and how to dig stairs.</li>
<li>How to set up rooms and workshops.</li>
<li>How to get some basic resource production and gathering going.</li>
</ul>
<p>One thing we haven’t covered is saving your game! Perhaps an
oversight?! Simply hit <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">Esc</span></code> and then select <span class="guilabel">Save Game</span>.
But don’t do it now! <span class="guilabel">Save Game</span> assumes you want to exit
and it will take you back to the main menu. Whatever you do, <strong>don’t</strong>
choose <span class="guilabel">Abandon the Fortress</span> - that ends the game!</p>
<p>I should note that saves can get confusing - if you start to play with
a seasonal autsave, then save that, the names get longer and don’t
always sort in a useful way.  When you come back
to DF and hit <span class="guilabel">Continue Game</span>” choosing the last save in the list
won’t necessarily result in your most recent game starting. Instead, you may
have to look in your <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;DF&gt;/data/save/</span></code> folder and see which folder has the
most recently modified files. Then you might rename or delete the older folders.</p>
<p>If you choose the wrong save, there are two options:  you can save as
usual and return to the main menu, or force-close DF with the DFHack
command <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">die</span></code>.  Enter it in the ingame console (<code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">Ctrl</span></code>-<code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">P</span></code>),
but be careful - this will quit without saving or checking again!</p>
<p>Good luck! And lets continue…</p>

<div class="section" id="making-our-hole-our-home">
<h2>3.2. Making our Hole our Home<a class="headerlink" href="#making-our-hole-our-home" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Lets look at making this place a little more comfortable for our
dwarves. First up, they really need a nice place to eat. Just picking at
food on the floor isn’t much fun, dwarves want a beautiful hall in which
they can quaff beer and eat cat biscuits (yes, you can make biscuits
out of cats. Ugggh). Lets help them set one up.</p>
<p>For now we’re going to set it up near our newly-dug space. I’m also
going to make a bunch of 2 by 2 rooms, which will serve as permanent
bedrooms for our dwarves. There’s no such thing as a perfect design, so
lets just get the function right and worry about the perfect layout in
your next fortress.</p>
<p>This is how I set things up:</p>
<img alt="../_images/03-dig.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/03-dig.png" />
<p>While it’s being dug, go add a bunch of beds to the carpenter’s shop,
as well as doors and tables and chairs at the masons. Report back in
when the rooms are dug and you’ve got a bunch of furniture and another
couple of tables and chairs.</p>
<p>…Ok, are you done? Good!</p>
<p>Now you need to go and place a bed in each room, a door on each
doorway, and tables and chairs in the dining room-t0-be. You should
know how to do all of this using <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">b</span></code> for <span class="guilabel">Build</span>, then
<code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">d</span></code> for <span class="guilabel">Door</span>, <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">t</span></code> for <span class="guilabel">Table</span>, and
<code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">c</span></code> for <span class="guilabel">Chair</span>… which in a Mason’s workshop is
called a <span class="guilabel">Throne</span>.  Yep, the same object can have different
names depending on the material - another reason using the shortcuts
can be easier than scrolling.</p>
<p>Here are my rooms partly completed. If you look closely you can see a
slacker dwarf having a nap.</p>
<img alt="../_images/03-beds-layout.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/03-beds-layout.png" />
<p>Can spot my chairs, tables, beds and doors? Pretty aren’t they!? You
may have noticed that bits of your local map are flashing. Don’t worry,
this just indicates that objects are sharing the same space with other
objects, but yes, all that stone does make things look messy. If you
have a tidy-fetish, GIVE IT UP NOW! Dwarf Fortress forts often look
messy with stone and junk strewn everywhere. You can, however, do a few
things to fix that, but we’ll worry about that some other time.
Meanwhile, we need to make ourselves a dinning room!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="whats-that-oh-bugger">
<h2>3.3. What’s that? Oh bugger!<a class="headerlink" href="#whats-that-oh-bugger" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Just got a message which reminded me that I’ve forgotten to do something…</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><span class="guilabel">The Outpost Liason from Vushuvash has arrived.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="guilabel">A caravan from Vushuvash has arrived.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="guilabel">Their wagons have bypassed your inaccessible site.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="guilabel">The merchants need a trade depot to unload their goods.</span></div>
</div>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Damn! A trade caravan arrived but couldn’t make it to our fortress
because, 1: it is inaccessible, 2: we don’t have a trade depot. This
may have happened to you already, if so, don’t worry about it much,
we’ll get that problem fixed soon. Trade caravans come by fairly
regularly and represent other civilisations wanting to trade their
valuables for yours. They are important, and handy, but we’ll discuss
them later some time.</p>
<p>Oh, you may get various windows pop up from the visiting trade liaison.
Just <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">Esc</span></code> back out of them for now.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="back-to-the-eating-place-thing">
<h2>3.4. Back to the eating place thing!<a class="headerlink" href="#back-to-the-eating-place-thing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>By now you should have the dining room furniture set up, so it’s time
to let the dwarves know it’s the official dining room of the fortress.
We do that in much the same way we set up bedrooms:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Hit <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">q</span></code> and move the cursor over any one of the tables (and for good
fun, move it over a chair and and read what sort of rooms chairs set up).</li>
<li>When over a table, hit <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">r</span></code>, and again you should see a flashing blue
box which doesn’t quite fill the room.</li>
<li>Use <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">=</span></code> to expand the room to fill the dining room space.</li>
<li>Hit <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">Enter</span></code>.</li>
<li>Now hit <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">h</span></code> to turn the dining room into a meeting hall as well.
The <span class="guilabel">(N)</span> on the menu will become a <span class="guilabel">(Y)</span>.</li>
<li><code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">Esc</span></code> back out to resume the game. All tables and chairs in the
entire space will now be used.</li>
</ul>
<p>Well done! A dining room and meeting hall is now set up! Without a
meeting space immigrant dwarves get confused and don’t know where to go
when they arrive, milling about at the edge of the map. A meeting space
seems to send out invisible mind-control rays and any newly-arrived
dwarves will immediately home in on it and into your fortress. Handy!</p>
<p>For amusement, go back up stairs and find the wagon we arrived with. I
bet you it has a few dwarves hanging around it. Know why? Because by
default your wagon is your first meeting area!</p>
<p>If you press <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">F1</span></code>, the map will move to the wagon - because it’s
also your first hotkey location.  The <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">H</span></code> hotkeys menu allows
you to scroll through the hotkeys, name each of them, and set one
to zoom to your current location - which saves time once you spread
out vertically.  Try setting <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">F2</span></code> to zoom to our big underground
rooms now.</p>
<p>But the wagon is outside and a long way from the fort and we’d much
prefer our dwarves to be safe and sound within our walls. We should
probably remove that temptation to stand outside and get killed by
carp, elephants, monkeys, unicorns, skeletal whales, zombies, giant
eagles, deer, goblins, etc, so lets remove the wagon. Hit <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">q</span></code> and move
the X over to the wagon, then hit <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">x</span></code> and the wagon will be
<span class="guilabel">Slated for removal</span>. This should free up a three logs
(which the wagon is made up)
and will prompt any lazy, slacker dwarves to head back inside!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="everyone-gets-their-own-room">
<h2>3.5. Everyone gets their own room!<a class="headerlink" href="#everyone-gets-their-own-room" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Dwarves love to have their own room, much preferring it to sharing a
dormitory (which they will do  by default otherwise), and conveniently
we have set up a number of little rooms. Lets declare that they’re
bedrooms, so our dwarves will come and claim one:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Go to your empty bedrooms, hit <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">q</span></code>.</li>
<li>Chose a bedroom, moving the X over a bed until it’s flashing.</li>
<li>Hit <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">r</span></code>. The blue selection area probably fills the room.</li>
<li>Hit <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">Enter</span></code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can assign the bedroom to a specific dwarf, but unless you want to
play favorites there’s no need - if a dwarf wants a nap and doesn’t
have a bedroom, they’ll claim one of the unowned ones.  Once that
happens, the bedroom status will now look something like this:</p>
<img alt="../_images/03-beds-dug.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/03-beds-dug.png" />
<p>If you get confused about a bedroom (or any room’s status), just hit
<code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">q</span></code> again and move around over each object. Of interest is the fact
that you can assign one room to have multiple uses, for example, put a
bed and table in the same room and specify that the room is both a
bedroom and a dining room, but doing so reduces the overall quality of
both rooms. Don’t bother unless you have some clever reason to.</p>
<p>While you’ve got your cursor up, move it over the door and look at
those options. You can lock doors and you can also make them impassable
to pets. Don’t bother with that for now, just have a look around.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="workshop-fun">
<h2>3.6. Workshop fun!<a class="headerlink" href="#workshop-fun" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Lets set up more workshops. First, put another mason’s workshop in with
the other one. It will be handy in the long run, I am sure. Set
up a couple of carpenter’s workshops in the room next door. While
you’re at it, set up a big wood pile (<code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">p</span></code>, <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">w</span></code>). The next thing to do
is to set up some more  piles. How about we go through and make a
<span class="guilabel">Finished Goods</span> pile? Build it using <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">p</span></code>, <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">g</span></code>.
Lets keep making stockpiles in those rooms. A few squares for cloth (<code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">h</span></code>),
leather, (<code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">l</span></code>), and bars/blocks (<code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">b</span></code>) makes sense. Where one pile
starts and another stops can get confusing, but give it your best shot.</p>
<p>Finally, lets also add a Craftsdwarf’s Workshop to our room. Use
<code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">b</span></code>, <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">w</span></code>, <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">r</span></code>, chose the materials and place the workshop.
These are particularly handy and profitable workshops, but more on them later!</p>
<p>This is how mine looks:</p>
<img alt="../_images/03-workshop.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/03-workshop.png" />
<p>That’s all for now, except before I go I have some homework for
you. But don’t worry, this is the fun kind of homework. See if you can
complete these tasks before we meet again:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Destroy the carpenter’s workshop upstairs.</li>
<li>Designate another wide area of trees to harvest. If the seasons have
changed to autumn by now you’ll notice all the trees a pretty gold
colour. Admire them before you saw them down.</li>
<li>Designate a bunch of plants to be harvested.</li>
<li>Make a lot more beer and a lot more barrels, or set up <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">workflow</span></code> for
some of the furniture you’ll need later (beds, doors, tables, chairs).</li>
<li>Make some <span class="guilabel">bins</span> in the carpenters shop - around 15 should do.
You’ll have to scroll to find them in the carpenter <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">a</span></code>
<span class="guilabel">Add new task</span> list, or use <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">a</span></code>, <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">n</span></code>.
Bins are what everything that isn’t food or booze are stored in.</li>
<li>Go to the mason’s workshop and set it to build blocks on repeat
(<code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">q</span></code>, <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">a</span></code>, <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">b</span></code>, <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">r</span></code>). Do this only if you’ve already
managed to make a LOT of bins or your Bar/Block pile will get filled
quickly!</li>
<li>See if you can make some stone crafts. You will find them under the
<code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">g</span></code> (<span class="guilabel">rock</span>) sub-menu from the <span class="guilabel">Add new task</span>
menu on the craftsdwarf’s workshop. Make sure you have lots of bins for
your crafts to go in though, and a big finished goods stockpile too!</li>
</ol>
<p>Good luck! And see you soon, in <a class="reference internal" href="chap04-crafts-farming.html#chapter04"><span class="std std-ref">the next chapter!</span></a></p>
