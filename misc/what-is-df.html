<h1>What is Dwarf Fortress?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-dwarf-fortress" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Above anything else, Dwarf Fortress is a complicated game.</p>
<p>Enough has been written about this already, so this will simply link to
some of the better articles for a background understanding.</p>

<div><p>Dwarf Fortress is a single-player fantasy game. You can control a
dwarven outpost or an adventurer in a randomly generated, persistent world.</p>
<p>Although Dwarf Fortress is still in a work in progress, many features
have already been implemented…</p>

<div><p>Dwarf Fortress is a mixture of classic turn-based fantasy adventure
games and sophisticated city building that has been confounding
observers since 2006. It’s visuals appear incomprehensible and
its learning curve not just steep and unending, but slippery and
sometimes electrified.</p>
<p>To look at Dwarf Fortress it is easy to imagine it as an
anachronistic throwback to the likes of Rogue and Nethack, a cute
little sort of retro tribute. However the truth of the matter,
which becomes rapidly more apparent as you learn exactly what is
being done within the game, is that this is not a primitive or old
fashioned game. Dwarf Fortress is spectacularly sophisticated. The
world that the game generates for you is created in the sort of
meticulous detail that would typically demand several hundred pages
of appendices at the end of a JRR Tolkien novel. Each created world
has a history, legendary figures, towns, cities and people. You can
create a world that is artificially aged up to a thousand years, or
you can start with a younger world, either approach bringing with it
different challenges. A new world might be untamed when a more
established one might be home to established communities of potential
foes such as goblins.</p>

<blockquote class="epigraph">
<div><p>Players are responsible for the cultivation and management of a
virtual ecosystem — a colony of dwarves trying to build a thriving
fortress in a randomly generated world. Dwarf Fortress unfolds as
a series of staggeringly elaborate challenges and devastating
setbacks that lead, no matter how well one plays, to eventual ruin.</p>
<p>Many simulation games offer players a bag of building blocks, but
few dangle a bag as deep, or blocks as small and intricately
interlocking, as Dwarf Fortress. Beneath the game’s rudimentary
facade is a dizzying array of moving parts, algorithms that model
everything from dwarves’ personalities (some are depressive; many
appreciate art) to the climate and economic patterns of the
simulated world. …</p>
