<p>You have come a long way, young jedi! Your dwarf herding skills are
strong! You now know the basics of building, production, trading and
managing your dwarves.</p>
<p>This is probably a good time to go read the tutorial on trading -
it ties in pretty well with a large industrial base.  Tutorials are
designed be skippable though, so if the thought of heavy industry
excites you, we can dive right in!</p>
<div class="section" id="more-production">
<h2>5.1. More Production!<a class="headerlink" href="#more-production" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Lets start with some new workshops you should get
to grips with. I won’t list the keys you need to use for every task,
you should be able to remember the basic stuff from earlier lessons, so
lets just get building these workshops around our four big production
rooms:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Mechanic’s Workshop</li>
<li>Leather Works</li>
<li>Farmer’s Workshop</li>
<li>Kitchen</li>
<li>Butchers</li>
<li>Metalsmith’s Forge</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, go to the Furnaces menu (from <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">b</span></code> and then <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">e</span></code> for
<span class="guilabel">Furnaces</span>) and build:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Wood Furnace</li>
<li>Smelter</li>
</ul>
<p>While those places get built lets look at expanding a bit. In the
middle of our four room area we have three stairs going down. Right now
they go nowhere, so lets go down about 5 levels. Remember, <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">d</span></code> and then
<code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">i</span></code> for <span class="guilabel">Up/Down Stairs</span>, set to the level below, will get that
construction going.</p>
<p>We also have room to expand between our production floor and our
entrance, so lets go up a level and put some storage there. I suggest
the easiest way to do this will be to <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">b</span></code>, build a <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">C</span></code>
constructed up-stair. So chose the space I highlight
below, and then follow along!</p>
<img alt="../_images/dftutorial79.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/dftutorial79.png" />
<p>Find the spot in the picture above, just below those down stairs.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Hit <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">b</span></code></li>
<li>Hit <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">C</span></code> (<code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">Shift</span></code>-<code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">c</span></code>)</li>
<li>Hit <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">u</span></code> for <span class="guilabel">Up Stair</span>.</li>
<li>Chose some stone.</li>
<li>Repeat to set three up stairs to be built.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the job is done you’ll have some stairs like this:</p>
<img alt="../_images/dftutorial80.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/dftutorial80.png" />
<p>Now we want to connect this level to the one above. If you go up a
level you won’t see anything but dirt, but we know the stairs are
leading up to this level, so it’s a matter of constructing some, right?
WRONG! We want to designate some stairs, because our miners will carve
out some matching stairs! We only use <span class="guilabel">Construct</span> when we’ve got an
empty space to deal with.</p>
<p>One challenge you’ll face is working out where on the floor above the
spot is you need to dig out. So try this technique:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Hit <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">d</span></code></li>
<li>Hit <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">i</span></code> for <span class="guilabel">Up/Down Stair</span>
(we want a series of stairs almost back up to the surface).</li>
<li>Put your X over the top stair in the line, like the screenshot</li>
</ul>
<img alt="../_images/dftutorial81.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/dftutorial81.png" />
<ul class="simple">
<li>Now go up a level and at the above level, designate three stairs in a
row (ie, hit enter, then hit down-arrow a couple of times, and then hit
enter), the above level should look like this:</li>
</ul>
<img alt="../_images/dftutorial82.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/dftutorial82.png" />
<p>You’ll note I wasn’t quick enough when I took this picture and two of
my three stairs are already dug out. Good dwarves!</p>
<p>With the new stairs dug out (providing easy access to all the space
we’re going to create for our production dwarves) lets make a massive
space for them to stockpile goods. Here’s how much I dug out:</p>
<img alt="../_images/05-storage.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/05-storage.png" />
<p>In case you’re wondering, that’s about a 40×40 box with our first
stairs at the bottom. And one nice thing about digging in dirt (which
this layer is), is that it doesn’t leave any messy rock around to
clutter up our nice stockpiles!</p>
<p>While that’s completing, lets start an important job, making our dining
room awesome! You see, dwarves love to spend time in an attractive
meeting hall. Right now mine is packed with loafers. They clearly need
a bit more room! A bit of digging will sort that:</p>
<img alt="../_images/05-meeting1.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/05-meeting1.png" />
<p>Once the room is expanded, fit doors and some more tables and chairs.
Once that’s done you’ll need to do something important, and that’s
resize the room. As you may remember we set the room up from one of the
tables. But if you <span class="guilabel">q</span> over the dining room table now you’ll see it
doesn’t fill the space:</p>
<img alt="../_images/05-meeting2.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/05-meeting2.png" />
<p>The room will be more valuable and widely used if it’s set to be
bigger, to fill this space. Lets do that now:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Hit <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">q</span></code> and move the X over the table which is setting the room up…</li>
<li>Hit <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">r</span></code> for <span class="guilabel">Resize Room</span>.</li>
<li>Using <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">=</span></code> expand the room size till you fill the space:</li>
</ul>
<img alt="../_images/05-meeting3.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/05-meeting3.png" />
<ul class="simple">
<li>Hit <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">Enter</span></code></li>
</ul>
<p>Job done! The room is resized and better. But we want to make it MUCH
better because I noticed a dwarf with a red down arrow flashing and
when I viewed his info it turned out he was pretty unimpressed with his
surroundings. Lets get to impressing him!</p>
<p>How do we do that? Simple! We smooth the walls and then engrave them
with fine carvings all about our fortress! To do this:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Hit <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">d</span></code>.</li>
<li>Hit <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">s</span></code> for <span class="guilabel">Smooth Stone</span>.</li>
<li>Select the entire dining room and walls using <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">Enter</span></code>, move cursor,
<code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">Enter</span></code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The room will now look all flashy like this (until you back out of the
menu, anyway):</p>
<img alt="../_images/05-meeting4.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/05-meeting4.png" />
<p>Any dwarf with the <span class="guilabel">Stone detailing</span> labour on will now set about
smoothing the walls and floors. The next step, once the space is
smooth, is to designate the room to be engraved using <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">d</span></code>, <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">e</span></code>.
Engraved walls make dwarves happy and increase the value of your
fortress. You can even look at them by using <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">k</span></code> and hitting enter with
the engraving highlighted. Some walls have some quite amusing
engravings (randomly generated and based on the history of your dwarves
and your fortress), so it’s worth looking around and finding the good
ones. The better the quality of the engraving the more text there is to
read, so keep an eye out for the engravings with the metal-bars icon
next to them.</p>
<p>With the smoothing under way, lets get back to the piles. In that big
space upstairs you can pretty much set up a space for everything it’s
possible to make a pile for (except refuse, of course, which we want to
be outside). So go do that now. Here’s how mine is laid out.</p>
<img alt="../_images/05-all-stockpiles.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/05-all-stockpiles.png" />
<p>Pretty complete huh? Well, almost, I’m sort of tempted to make a stone
pile and using custom settings have it as metal ores only. It would
make things a bit tidier, but on the other hand probably doesn’t gain
me that much efficiency right now. Be very careful with stone
stockpiles, hauling stone can consume a heap of your dwarves’ time,
which is a bit pointless.</p>

<div class="section" id="hotel-califortress">
<h2>5.2. Hotel Califortress!<a class="headerlink" href="#hotel-califortress" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We’ve got some new workshops set up, we’ve got some great storage, and
we’ve dug down a few levels. Good stuff! Unfortunately, (or
fortunately?) you’ve probably had a bunch of immigrants arrive over the
course of the past couple of tutorials and they haven’t been assigned
anywhere to live. We also don’t have any space dug out for the
inevitable arrival of nobles, and these boys and girls are one set of
dwarves that need hard work to keep happy!</p>
<p>Fortunately we’ve dug down a few levels and we have a lot of nice rock
down there. So lets go take some time to lay out some great bedrooms
for our dwarves. The majority of your rooms should be 2×2, but lets make
some space for nobles too.</p>
<p>Nobles usually want two-to-four rooms. So lets make things easy and
give them all four rooms of size 3×3 or so, that should be good enough.
Here’s how I have planned out my bedroom level:</p>
<img alt="../_images/05-big-bedrooms.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/05-big-bedrooms.png" />
<p>A couple of points. Firstly, the whole right side of my new bedroom
level won’t be dug because it’s not connected to the stairs, etc. I’ll
connect it up later once we’ve got the left side done. Second, my
layout is pretty boring, go and check out some of the bedroom designs
on the wiki. I love the fractal pattern! Very efficient! Finally,
you’ll notice the big wide corridors for the main arterial routes.
dwarves need space to move around, remember!</p>
<p>Also, remember that you will need a lot of new doors and beds for our
beautiful hotel. While you’re at it, build a ton of tables and chairs
and at least a half dozen coffers, cabinets, armor stands, weapon
stands. You’ll find all those items under the masonry workshop menus.
Oh, and lets connect up the southern most stairs (the first ones we
built way back in tutorial 1 or 2) with this level as well. Construct
down stairs from the workshop floor and then designate Up/Down stairs
till we’re all connected up.</p>
<p>While that is being built (oh, we’re going to find some gems too,
cool!) lets continue with-</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="dwarves-and-their-strange-moods">
<h2>5.3. Dwarves and their strange moods!<a class="headerlink" href="#dwarves-and-their-strange-moods" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Oh dear! Something is going down in dwarf land!</p>
<blockquote>
<div><span class="guilabel">Endok Oltarisos, Tanner, withdraws from society…</span></div></blockquote>
<p>If you get a dwarf in a strange mood, find them using <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">u</span></code>, looking for
their name, and then <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">c</span></code>. You will see the dwarf flashing with a grey
exclamation mark (red is very bad, by the way). Follow this dwarf
closesly. This dwarf has got a strange mood and is off to claim a
workshop to start building some amazing object based on their whim and
fancy. We can’t control what they build, all we can do is hope they
build something cool and that they can find all the materials they want
for their fancy. If not, they go suicidal or homicidal. Oh dear! Lets
watch and see what happens. Of course, this event is random, so it
might not happen to you at this point in the game, but it will happen
sooner or later.</p>
<p>Right, my dwarf, Endok Oltarisos has rushed off to claim a leather
workshop. No surprise, he’s a tanner after all. Once he claims the
workshop you can <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">q</span></code> and see the status of the workshop, and if you
wait, it will scroll through what items the dwarf is looking for. Endok
is looking for <span class="guilabel">stacked leather</span> and <span class="guilabel">skeletons</span>.
I’m not sure if I’ve got any. I’ll find out pretty quickly though,
the dwarf will either run off and start fetching stuff, or sit in
the workshop, seemingly doing nothing…</p>
<img alt="../_images/dftutorial92.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/dftutorial92.png" />
<p>Well, the leather isn’t a problem, I just bought a ton from a trader,
and the bones, I think he’s grabbed some from the refuse pile.
Thankfully, my worries about the dwarf not getting stuff are put to
rest when I get this message:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><span class="guilabel">Endok Oltarisos has begun a mysterious construction!</span></div></blockquote>
<p>Endok has begun a mysterious construction! Great! Now we just wait and
see what crazy object the dwarf produces. With luck it will be useful!</p>
<blockquote>
<div><span class="guilabel">Endok Oltarisos, Tanner, has created Modonnokoi, a dog
leather cap!</span></div></blockquote>
<p>..or maybe not! Our dwarf has made a cap, a simple hat, out of dog
leather! Damn! On the plus side though the dwarf has become a legendary
tanner. If they gain skill from a mood it often leaves them
Legendary, which is pretty neat. With legendary skill I could use
Endok to make leather armour and it would be almost as good as metal armour.</p>
<p>Lets look at the item. If we hit <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">l</span></code> we get a list of artefacts. With
only one artefact there’s no list, so we can go straight in to hitting
<code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">v</span></code> to :guilabel`View`. Behold! Triberiddle, the dog leather cap!</p>
<img alt="../_images/dftutorial95.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/dftutorial95.png" />
<p>A nice hat depicting when one of the trade caravan guards shot a
goblin. No one will wear it though, it’s an <a class="reference external" href="http://dwarffortresswiki.org/artifact">artifact</a>, and only
champions are important enough to grab artifacts from stockpiles.</p>
<p>We were lucky this time with our moody dwarf. He was able to get
everything he needed to make his artifact. If he couldn’t find it he
would go quite crazy in the workshop, or if a suitable workshop isn’t
available, in his room. When you see the dwarf start to go crazy
(flashing down arrows and not moving from their workshop are a good
sign) it’s time to either assign the dwarf some war dogs (more on that
later) or to construct some walls and wall them in to their workshop,
or to lock the door on their quarters. At some point the dwarf will go
beserk and either get attacked by nearby military dwarves or war dogs,
or if locked inside, slowly starve to death.</p>
<p>If the crazy dwarf is ignored they will destroy stuff and attack
dwarves, probably killing a couple before they are put down, so watch
those moody stunties closely!</p>
<p>In <a class="reference internal" href="chap06-traps.html#chapter06"><span class="std std-ref">the next chapter</span></a>, we’ll cover traps - used to “mine” a
kind of iron ore the community calls “goblinite”.  See you then!</p>
