<p>This is the final chapter of the Dwarf Fortress walkthrough.</p>

<h2>9.1. Marksdwarves for Pest &amp; Goblin Control<a class="headerlink" href="#marksdwarves-for-pest-goblin-control" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>It was about this time that I realized that the grazing animals in
their pastures outside had scattered and the dwarves attempting to
round them up were fleeing in abject terror. The reason was clear:
at the bottom of the screen I saw:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><span class="guilabel">Etur Ozarlolor, Farmer cancels Pen/Pasture Stray Water
Buffalo Calf (Tame): Interrupted by Kea.</span></div></blockquote>
<p>Bringing up the <span class="guilabel">Units</span> screen by
pressing <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">u</span></code> and scrolling right to <span class="guilabel">Others</span>, I
select a <span class="guilabel">Kea</span>. Bracing myself, I press <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">v</span></code> and lay
my eyes on the beast.</p>
<p><span class="guilabel">A small, green, intelligent mountain parrot.</span></p>
<p>Terrifying stuff. Let`s locate it on the map. Go back to the
<span class="guilabel">Units</span> screen, select a <span class="guilabel">Kea</span>, and press
<code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">z</span></code> to <span class="guilabel">Go to Unit</span>.</p>
<img alt="../_images/09-2-archers.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/09-2-archers.png" />
<p>The keas are flying around up in the sky, out of reach of our
military. This seems like a great time to organize a marksdwarf
militia! Marksdwarves are an excellent tool for repelling invasions
of non-undead creatures because they can engage from behind
fortifications without exposing themselves to much danger.</p>
<p>First, let`s build some archery targets.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Press <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">b</span></code>, <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">A</span></code> (or find <span class="guilabel">Archery Target</span> at
the bottom).</li>
<li>Place four or more in a room somewhere. I built mine in the spare
room next to the melee squad barracks:</li>
</ul>
<img alt="../_images/09-3-archers.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/09-3-archers.png" />
<ul class="simple">
<li>Hit <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">q</span></code> over a target.</li>
<li>Hit <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">q</span></code> for <span class="guilabel">Make Archery Range</span>.</li>
<li>Increase the blue size until it covers each of the targets
neatly, hit <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">Enter</span></code>.</li>
<li>Look at the top right. You’ll see <span class="guilabel">Shoot: From Left to Right.</span>
Use <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">wasd</span></code> to chose the proper direction. For me, I want them
shooting down so I hit <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">s</span></code>.</li>
<li>Repeat this on each target you placed. Unfortunately, a bug
necessitates this micromanagement.</li>
<li>Job done! Range is now ready!</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, we need some warm bodies to fill the ranks.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Make a squad of six or more slackers. Ten is great.</li>
<li>Set them to use the <span class="guilabel">Archer</span> preset uniform. This
includes leather armor (if you have any) and a crossbow of any
material.</li>
<li>Make a bunch of wood crossbows. Crossbow ranged attacks are
identical across material type, so wood ones are fine. Wood
crossbows are made at a <span class="guilabel">Bowyers Workshop</span> (<code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">b</span></code>,
<code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">w</span></code>, <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">b</span></code>). Material type for ranged weapons only effects
their damage in melee.</li>
<li>Unlike shields, bucklers can be used simultaneously with
crossbows but give a penalty to hit. Build some if you`re feeling
generous.</li>
<li>Marksdwarves should only be used from behind
<span class="guilabel">Fortifications</span> or against harmless pests, so armor is
not necessary. But, if you like, armor certainly helps when an
<span class="guilabel">Elite Goblin Crossbowman</span> starts threading bolts through
your carefully-constructed <span class="guilabel">Fortifications</span>. If you
decide to use metal armor, be sure to edit the archer squad’s
uniform accordingly with <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">m</span></code>, <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">e</span></code>, <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">U</span></code>.</li>
<li>Queue up some more backpacks and quivers at the
<span class="guilabel">Leather Works</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately, a bug often prevents marksdwarves from switching
between bolts of different materials for combat and training.
Therefore, we have to ensure that we use a single material type of
bolt for training and combat. We have lots of bone lying around
outside in our refuse stockpile, so let`s make bone bolts for now:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Build one or two <span class="guilabel">Craftsdwarfs Workshops</span> next to the
outdoor refuse pile.</li>
<li>Queue up <span class="guilabel">Make bone bolts</span> and set it on repeat or use
workflow to make about 400.</li>
<li>Hit <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">m</span></code>, <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">a</span></code>, <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">f</span></code>, to bring up the
<span class="guilabel">Ammunition</span> menu.</li>
<li>Select your marksdwarf squad. To ensure that only bone bolts are
used in combat and training:</li>
<li>Select the exiting bolts and hit <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">d</span></code> to delete them.</li>
<li>Hit <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">c</span></code>, select <span class="guilabel">bolts</span>, press <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">Enter</span></code>, then
hit <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">M</span></code> and select <span class="guilabel">bone</span>.</li>
<li>Ensure that the resulting <span class="guilabel">bone bolts</span> are used in
training and combat by pressing <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">T</span></code> and <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">C</span></code>.</li>
<li>Change the amount to 200 with <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">+</span></code>/<code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">-</span></code>.
Your ammo screen should look like this:</li>
</ul>
<img alt="../_images/09-4-archers.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/09-4-archers.png" />
<ul class="simple">
<li>Make sure that your marksdwarf squad is set to
<span class="guilabel">Active/Training</span> in the <span class="guilabel">Military</span> screen
(<code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">m</span></code>, <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">a</span></code>).</li>
<li>Set up your Marksdwarves training schedule like you did with your
melee squads. Hit <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">m</span></code>, <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">s</span></code> to bring up the
<span class="guilabel">Squad Schedules</span> panel, navigate to <span class="guilabel">Squad
Schedules: Active/Training</span> with <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">/</span></code><code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">*</span></code>, and set your new
Marksdwarf squad to train with at 2 or 3 minimum for every month.</li>
<li>With everything set up correctly, your marksdwarves should grab
some equipment and start practicing!</li>
</ul>
<p>Due to a bug, dwarves sometimes cannot drop carried ammo in order
to pick up ammo of a different material type, such as iron. This
can cause them to never practice or even fail to engage the enemy
because they cannot drop their ammo in order to pick up practice or
war ammo. You may be affected by this bug if you eventually decide
to switch from bone bolts to metal bolts, which are much deadlier.
If you have problems, consult the DF Wiki.</p>

<h2>9.2. Putting the Fortress in Dwarf Fortress<a class="headerlink" href="#putting-the-fortress-in-dwarf-fortress" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Congratulations on your new squad of marksdwarves! Besides
<span class="guilabel">Kea</span> sniping, marksdwarves are great at defending from
behind <span class="guilabel">fortifications</span>. Let’s make some!</p>
<p>There are a few important things to keep in mind when building
complex fortress defenses:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Enemies will take the shortest path from the outside into your
fortress.</li>
<li>Some enemies can destroy doors and other furniture, but none can
destroy closed draw bridges or constructed walls.</li>
<li>Marksdwarves must stand adjacent to <span class="guilabel">fortifications</span> in
order to shoot through them, so it`s a good idea to make 1-tile
wide halls adjacent to <span class="guilabel">fortifications</span> and use burrows
to ensure they stand in the right spot.</li>
<li>You should also account for the unexpected - attackers that
can fly, jump, climb, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>The specific design of your fortifications and traps is limited
only by your creativity. The design below is an example of
maximizing the distance that attackers must cover while being
exposed to marksdwarf fire. As the attackers wind down the descent,
they are exposed to fire from the fortified gallery above. Then,
they must get past the melee squads in the secondary killzone which
is also covered by a fortified gallery. You can make far more
complex (and satisfying) defenses than this - TinyPirate’s
automatic minecart shotgun is a noteworthy example!</p>
<img alt="../_images/09-1-fort.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/09-1-fort.png" />
<img alt="../_images/09-2-fort.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/09-2-fort.png" />
<img alt="../_images/09-3-fort.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/09-3-fort.png" />
<img alt="../_images/09-4-fort.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/09-4-fort.png" />
<p>Though formidible, these defenses are incomplete. Can you see the
flaw? Our main stairwell is wide open, protected only by some
traps! Remember that attackers will use the shortest route to get
into your fortress, and right now the shortest route is over those
traps. Let’s build a drawbridge that we can raise to block off our
main entrance and force attackers to take the route through the
killzone.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Hit <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">b</span></code>, <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">g</span></code> to bring up the <span class="guilabel">Bridge</span>
placement menu.</li>
<li>Use <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">u</span></code>, <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">m</span></code> and <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">k</span></code>, <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">h</span></code> to create a 3x3
footprint and place it at the entrance to the fortress, adjacent to
the first line of traps.</li>
<li>By default, bridges retract when activated. We want ours to raise
to the left so that when raised, it blocks access to the fortress.
Hit <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">a</span></code> to accomplish this.</li>
<li>Hit <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">Enter</span></code> to place the bridge and use stone blocks to
build it.</li>
<li>A Dwarf with the Architecture labor enabled will come to design
the bridge and a Mason will then construct it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now we need to hook the bridge up to some kind of mechanism to
raise it. The most straightforward method is to connect it to a
lever. Levers do not need to be near the machines they operate, so
let`s build ours in a high traffic area near the dining hall.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Hit <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">b</span></code>, <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">T</span></code>, <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">l</span></code> and place the lever near the
dining hall.</li>
<li>Once the lever and bridge are built, hit <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">q</span></code>, place the
cursor on the lever, and hit <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">a</span></code>, <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">b</span></code> to bring up a list
of bridges it can be linked to.</li>
<li>You should have only one bridge. If you have more, select the
entrance bridge and hit <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">Enter</span></code> to <span class="guilabel">Assign</span> it to
the lever.</li>
<li>Use any old mechanisms. Mechanism quality only effects the time
delay for traps to fire when sprung, not bridges.</li>
<li>You`ll see the <span class="guilabel">Link a Building to Trigger</span> job on the
lever’s <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">q</span></code> screen. A Mechanic will use the two mechanisms you
selected to hook them up.</li>
<li>To raise/lower the bridge, hit <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">q</span></code>, place the cursor on the
lever, hit <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">a</span></code> to <span class="guilabel">Add new task</span>, <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">P</span></code>. If the
situation is critical - eg during a siege - hit <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">n</span></code> for
<span class="guilabel">Do task now!</span> and the closest Dwarf will run to pull it.</li>
<li>Go ahead and test it out. Be careful: any object or creature on
the bridge when it raises will be flung across the map! Bridges can
be weaponized in this way.</li>
<li>Lastly, build a stone wall north of the bridge to seal off the
diagonal gap. Good job! Now we can funnel attackers into our kill
zone with a pull of a lever!</li>
</ul>
<p>The finished bridge in the raised position:</p>

<h2>9.3. Assigning Battle Stations<a class="headerlink" href="#assigning-battle-stations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Finally, it’s a great idea to set up burrows for each killzone
gallery. Although you can use <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">s</span></code>, <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">m</span></code> to move squads
around, Marksdwarves have a bad habit of never standing in the
right position to shoot the massive army bearing down on them. A
failsafe method is to use the <span class="guilabel">Alerts</span> screen (<code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">m</span></code>,
<code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">a</span></code>) in conjunction with burrows.</p>
<p>Remember the <span class="guilabel">Inside</span> burrow we set up to keep civilians
inside? The same principle applies here. We will make a tiny burrow
for each killzone gallery, create cooresponding alert states, and
set up orders to defend the specific burrow when the alert state is
active. This will cause the squad subject to the alert to
immediately move to the correct burrow.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Start by creating a burrow on the main killzone gallery
encompassing the areas where marksdwarves must stand to shoot -
directly adjacent to the fortifications. Name this burrow “Prm
Kllzn Gallery”.</li>
<li>Do the same for the secondary killzone gallery. Name it “Sec
Kllzn Gallery”.</li>
<li>Make a burrow in the melee staging area as well. Name it “Melee
Staging”.</li>
<li>Hit <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">m</span></code>, <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">a</span></code> and create three new alerts with
descriptive names like “Prim. Kllzn. Gallery”, “Sec. Kllzn.
Gallery”, and “Melee Staging Area.” Use <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">c</span></code> to <span class="guilabel">Add
alert</span> and <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">N</span></code> to <span class="guilabel">Name alert</span>. Here is how the
alerts panel should look:</li>
</ul>
<img alt="../_images/09-6-fort.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/09-6-fort.png" />
<p>Now we will associate each of these alerts with a cooresponding
burrow so that when a squad is set to, for example, “Prim. Kllzn.
Gallery” alert, it moves to occupy the “Prm Kllzn Gallery” burrow.
The game calls this an <span class="guilabel">Order</span> and manages orders with
the <span class="guilabel">Squad Schedules</span> interface.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Hit <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">m</span></code>, <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">s</span></code> to bring up the <span class="guilabel">Squad
Schedules</span> interface. Make sure our first melee squad column is
highligted.</li>
<li>Use <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">/</span></code>/<code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">*</span></code> to cycle to the <span class="guilabel">Prim. Kllzn.
Gallery</span> alert (displayed in the gray bar at the top of the screen).</li>
<li>Hit <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">o</span></code> to <span class="guilabel">Give order</span>. Hit <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">o</span></code> again until
the <span class="guilabel">Defend burrows</span> order appears.</li>
<li>Highlight <span class="guilabel">Prm Kllzn Gallery</span> and press <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">Enter</span></code> to
<span class="guilabel">Select</span> it.</li>
<li>Use <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">-</span></code>/<code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">+</span></code> to set the minimum number of soldiers to the
number in the squad as displayed on the right. Each of our melee
squads should have three soldiers, so get it down to <span class="guilabel">3
soldiers minimum</span>.</li>
<li>Press <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">Shift</span></code>-<code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">Enter</span></code> to enter the changes.</li>
<li>Hit <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">c</span></code> to copy the order and <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">p</span></code> to paste it to each
month for our first melee squad. We can also paste the order for
each month under our second melee squad because that squad also has
three dwarves.</li>
<li>For the Marksdwarf squad, do the same steps above but instead of
three soldiers minimum, use however many soldiers are in the
Marksdwarf squad. I have ten and I want them all to show up when I
give the order, so I set 10 minimum.</li>
<li>“Prim. Kllzn. Gallery” alert is set up!</li>
<li>Now just do the same steps for each separate alert, but use the
appropriate burrow for each. On the <span class="guilabel">Squad Schedules</span>
panel, press <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">/</span></code>, <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">*</span></code> to cycle to the next alert over,
<span class="guilabel">Sec. Kllzn. Gallery</span> and set it up so that the
<span class="guilabel">Sec Kllzn Gallery</span> burrow is used. After you`re done
setting up that alert, do the same for the last alert -
<span class="guilabel">Melee Staging Area</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>To order a squad to man a position, hit <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">m</span></code>, <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">a</span></code>,
highlight an alert, use <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">6</span></code> or the arrow keys to higlight the
squad you want to move, and press <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">Enter</span></code> so that a green
<span class="guilabel">A</span> appears next to the squad. The squad will execute the
<span class="guilabel">Defend Burrow</span> order we set above and move to the burrow
with weapons out and armor on. Although somewhat cumbersome, this
will guarantee that your Marksdwarves man an effective fighting
position at the critical time. Go ahead and give it a try.</p>
<img alt="../_images/09-7-fort.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/09-7-fort.png" />
<p>With “Prim. Kllzn. Gallery” highlighted, the green <span class="guilabel">A</span>
shows that The Merchants of Conjuring are under this alert and are
moving to the “Prm Kllzn Gallery” burrow.</p>

<div class="section" id="further-fortifications">
<h2>9.4. Further Fortifications<a class="headerlink" href="#further-fortifications" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The surface entrance to our underground deathtrap is a choke point
for attackers and will cause them to bunch up as they try to get
in. Let`s build a tower to shower them with death! Here is a design
I came up with that uses the existing stairs that run through the
barracks. As a bonus, it covers the entrance way as well.</p>
<p>The main Marksdwarf gallery is directly above the drawbridge. It
uses the terrain to cover the north and is completely sealed off
from the outside.</p>
<img alt="../_images/09-1-tower.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/09-1-tower.png" />
<p>A stone roof seals it from above. Create roofs by building floors
on the level above: <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">b</span></code>, <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">C</span></code>, <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">f</span></code>. Note: walls
create floors on the square directly above them, but fortifications
do not. Remember to build floors above all fortifications or
nasties will drop in from above!</p>
<img alt="../_images/09-2-tower.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/09-2-tower.png" />
<p>Access is through a staircase…</p>
<img alt="../_images/09-3-tower.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/09-3-tower.png" />
<p>…that leads to the barracks below ground.</p>
<img alt="../_images/09-4-tower.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/09-4-tower.png" />
<p>Don`t forget to set up a burrow for this tower just like in the
previous section!</p>

<img alt="../_images/09-1-invader.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/09-1-invader.png" />
<p>The first test of my defenses came somewhat after this when a
<span class="guilabel">Giant</span> appeared on the southwest corner of the map:</p>
<img alt="../_images/09-2-invader.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/09-2-invader.png" />
<p>Lets see how tough our defenses are. Our priority is to get
everyone inside, batten down the hatches, and man the outer defenses.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Set the civilian alert to <span class="guilabel">Siege</span> (<code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">m</span></code>, <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">a</span></code>,
then select siege and press <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">Enter</span></code>). This restricts civilians
to the <span class="guilabel">Inside</span> burrow and will cause them to drop
everything and run inside. Now is also a good time to ensure that
your <span class="guilabel">Inside</span> burrow is in fact inside and out of the
line of fire!</li>
<li>Station our Marksdwarf squad in the primary killzone gallery. Hit
<code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">a</span></code>, select the <span class="guilabel">Prim. Kllzn. Gallery</span>
<span class="guilabel">Alert</span>, move right to the <span class="guilabel">Squads</span> column,
highlight the Marksdwarf squad, and hit <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">Enter.</span></code> A green
<span class="guilabel">A</span> next to the Marksdwarf squad means that they will
move to that burrow.</li>
<li>Station our Melee squads in the melee staging area. Use the same
procedure as above, but activate the <span class="guilabel">Melee Staging Area</span>
<span class="guilabel">Alert</span> for them.</li>
<li>Now the tricky part. We need to shut our main drawbridge when
everyone is inside but before the <span class="guilabel">Giant</span> arrives. A good
method is to pause the game and use <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">.</span></code> to advance time
incrementally. Keep your eye on that Giant! If anyone
is left outside, they will have to outrun the Giant as

<li>If you lose track of the Giant, use the
<span class="guilabel">Units</span> screen (<code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">u</span></code>) to find it in the
<span class="guilabel">Others</span> submenu and hit <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">z</span></code> to <span class="guilabel">Go to

<li>When the time is right, close the drawbridge by hitting <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">q</span></code>,

<code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">n</span></code>. Bridges shut slowly, so give lots of time!</li>
</ul>
<p>The gate shuts, our dwarves are in position, and the
<span class="guilabel">Giant</span> is making a beeline for the killzones. Perfect.
Just remember to reposition your Marksdwarves if the
<span class="guilabel">Giant</span> makes it underground!</p>
<p>I mistime the throw of the lever but the <span class="guilabel">Giant</span> is
distracted by the strategic diversionary livestock pastured
outside, giving time for the gate to shut! Those poor sheep, though…</p>
<img alt="../_images/09-3-invader.gif" class="align-center" src="../_images/09-3-invader.gif" />
<p>The Giant pauses to destroy the Craftsdwarf`s Workshops
outside, then descends into the killzones…</p>
<img alt="../_images/09-4-invader.gif" class="align-center" src="../_images/09-4-invader.gif" />
<p>and is struck down by the waiting melee squads.</p>
<p>Our defenses worked! It`s always fun to look at the combat log -
hit <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">r</span></code>, scroll down to <span class="guilabel">the Giant Theveme

<img alt="../_images/09-5-invader.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/09-5-invader.png" />
<p>Scrolling up past the pages of Dwarves beating on the
<span class="guilabel">Giant</span>, I notice that the <span class="guilabel">Giant</span> dodged a
bolt when it entered the killzone. Look back at the second GIF
above. Do you see what happened? The <span class="guilabel">Giant</span> appeared on
the first level of the killzone walkway and immediately came under
fire. When it dodged, it went over the side and landed on the
second walkway! It was only a 1-z level drop so it did no damage,
but what if we lined the killzone with iron spikes? There`s always
room for improvement in fortress defenses!</p>

<h2>9.6. Medic!!<a class="headerlink" href="#medic" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If you`ve made it this far without a dwarven casualty, you are
extremely lucky! Injury is a certainty in Dwarf Fortress, but
adequate healthcare will keep your maimed citizens from succumbing
to blood loss or infection. Dwarven healthcare is complex to set
up, but a hospital system will keep even badly mangled dwarves in
the army/workforce and prevent fort-ending tantrum spirals due to
loss of loved ones. Once running, the whole thing is automated and
requires little management.</p>
<p>A hospital requires:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A source of fresh water - preferrably not muddy to minimize
infection.</li>
<li>Cloth - for bandages.</li>
<li>Thread - for sutchurs.</li>
<li>Splints - to set broken limbs.</li>
<li>Crutches - allow injured Dwarves to be useful while recovering.</li>
<li>Buckets - to wash and give water to patients (patients can drink
only water in the hospital!)</li>
<li>Beds - allow patients to be diagnosed, rest, and receive water.</li>
<li>Tables - for surgical operations.</li>
<li>Traction benches - immobilize patients when setting bones.</li>
<li>Soap - to clean wounds and prevent infection.</li>
<li>Gypsum powder - for casts.</li>
<li>A chief medical dwarf - to diagnose injuries, assigned in the
nobles screen (<code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">n</span></code>).</li>
<li>Doctors - Dwarves with the various healthcare jobs enabled.</li>
</ul>
<p>That sounds like a whole lot, but you likely have most of it on
hand. Get started by designating a hospital zone. I evicted
everyone from our original set of bedrooms and hollowed out those
rooms to be my hospital zone.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Hit <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">i</span></code>, place the zone and <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">h</span></code> to make it a hospital.</li>
<li>Build and place beds and traction benches in the hospital zone
with tables adjacent to them. Adjacent tables make it easier to
move a patient for surgury.</li>
<li>You probably will need to build some chains or ropes for the
traction benches. The traction benches themselves are made at the
Mechanic’s workshop using one chain/rope, one mechanisms, and a
table.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a setup with tables and traction benches clustered around
the beds:</p>
<img alt="../_images/09-1-hospital.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/09-1-hospital.png" />
<ul class="simple">
<li>Hospitals require containers to store supplies. Hit <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">b</span></code>,
<code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">h</span></code> to build six or so <span class="guilabel">Containers</span> within the
hospital zone. Coffers are best because bags are used in other
industries.</li>
<li>Once the containers are placed, Dwarves will start stocking the
hospital zone with supplies. Let`s take a look at those parameters.
Hit <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">i</span></code>, place the cursor over the hospital zone, and hit
<code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">H</span></code> to <span class="guilabel">Set hospital parameters</span>.</li>
</ul>
<img alt="../_images/09-2-hospital.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/09-2-hospital.png" />
<p>Already, we have enough <span class="guilabel">Thread</span> and <span class="guilabel">Cloth</span>.
Note that hospital item counts are a thousand times the acutal units,
so you don’t really need 75,000 stacks of cloth.
Let`s move on to the other items.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>That bucket count looks low. Select <span class="guilabel">Buckets: 0/2</span> with
<code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">2</span></code>/<code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">8</span></code> and use <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">6</span></code>/<code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">4</span></code> to increase it to 10.</li>
<li>Queue up 10 splints, 10 crutches, and 20 buckets at the
Carpenter’s Workshop.</li>
<li>Build a <span class="guilabel">Kiln</span> with <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">b</span></code>, <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">e</span></code>, <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">k</span></code> and
queue up 10 <span class="guilabel">Make plaster powder</span> jobs. Each job requires
a bag and a boulder of gypsum or other plaster-making stone, and we
have gypsum in abundance.</li>
<li>Build a <span class="guilabel">Soap Makers Workshop</span> (<code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">b</span></code>, <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">w</span></code>,
<code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">S</span></code>) and an <span class="guilabel">Ashery</span> (<code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">b</span></code>, <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">w</span></code>, <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">y</span></code>).</li>
<li>Soap’s recipe is: Lye + Tallow/Oil = Soap. Lye is made from ash
at a Wood Furnace. Queue up 10 units of ash at the Wood Furnace and
10 units of Lye at the Ashery. Finally queue up 10 units of soap
(<span class="guilabel">Make soap from tallow</span>) at the Soap Maker’s Workshop.
If you have no tallow, butcher an animal and a Dwarf will
automatically render the fat into tallow at a Butcher’s Shop.</li>
</ul>
<p>Great work! While your dwarves execute all the orders you’ve put
in, let’s secure a source of fresh water. Easy access to fresh
water is essential because injured dwarves cannot drink booze.
Moreover, water must be brought to them as they lay injured in bed.
Therefore, it`s critical to have a year-round source of fresh water
close to our hospital. Otherwise, injured dwarves will die from
dehydration in their hospital beds.</p>
<p>Let`s take stock of the fresh water sources we have available.</p>
<img alt="../_images/09-3-hospital.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/09-3-hospital.png" />
<p>To the east we have a number of small ponds. When we look at the
water in them with <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">k</span></code>, we see <span class="guilabel">Murky Pool</span> filled
with <span class="guilabel">Stagnant Water [7/7]</span>. Murky pools are no good to
us because <span class="guilabel">Stagnant Water</span> increases the risk of
infection when used to wash wounds and also creates an unhappy
thought in any Dwarf that drinks it. Moreover, these pools are
frozen for half the year! That pretty much rules these out unless
we have no other choice.</p>
<img alt="../_images/09-4-hospital.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/09-4-hospital.png" />
<p>Fortunately, we have a small river in the northeastern portion of
the map. Using <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">k</span></code> to look at its water, we see that it`s
fresh, wholesome, <span class="guilabel">Water [7/7]</span>. This is what we`ve been
looking for. The only problem is that like the <span class="guilabel">Murky
Pools</span>, the river is frozen much of the year and it`s very far from
the hospital. However, if we divert the water into an underground
cistern, it will not freeze and we can accumulate enough to last us
through the cold months. Let`s do some hydrological engineering!</p>
<p>First, let’s dig out our cistern. It`s best to locate it near the
hospital and it needs to be at least two z-levels deep to avoid mud
contamination. If water is taken from a 1 z-level source and the
floor has a <span class="guilabel">Pile of mud</span> on it, the water will cause
infections. The easiest way to avoid this is to make the cistern
two or more layers deep. Here is where I placed mine:</p>
<img alt="../_images/09-5-hospital.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/09-5-hospital.png" />
<p>It goes down an additional 3 z-levels directly below the well room:</p>
<img alt="../_images/09-6-hospital.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/09-6-hospital.png" />
<p>Now we have to bring the water to the cistern. Easy, right? Just
dig a really long trench from the river and connect it up.
Actually, that`s a recipe for a flooded fortress! Water pressure
will act to force the river water - flowing from above our cistern
- up over the top of it and into the rest of the fortress. So, we
need to use floodgates controlled by levers to manage the water
flow. The only wrong way to accomplish this is the one that floods
the fortress, but below is an example scheme that prioritizes flood
safety.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Queue up 20 floodgates from the Masons.</li>
<li>Stick a door on the well room. If the worst happens, you can
always lock that door to stop the water until you figure out what
to do. Also, keep pets out of it by pressing <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">o</span></code> with the door
selected - pets have a bad habit of drowning in cisterns and
spillways.</li>
<li>Dig a spillway tunnel from the top of the cistern to the edge of
the map, then <span class="guilabel">Smooth</span> (<code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">d</span></code>, <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">s</span></code>) and
<span class="guilabel">Carve fortifications</span> (<code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">d</span></code>, <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">F</span></code>) on the stone
at the edge of the map. That will allow water to flow off the edge
of the map in the event of overflow, relieving pressure in the
cistern.</li>
</ul>
<img alt="../_images/09-7-hospital.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/09-7-hospital.png" />
<ul class="simple">
<li>Build <span class="guilabel">Floodgates</span> (<code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">b</span></code>, <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">x</span></code>) between the
cistern and the spillway. Make sure to leave one tile free adjacent
to the floodgates to allow access for when we hook them up to the
control lever.</li>
<li>Build a <span class="guilabel">Lever</span> (<code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">b</span></code>, <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">T</span></code>, <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">l</span></code>). Place
it in a location where you’ll remember what it does and where it
will be accessible in the event of a flood. You can use a
<span class="guilabel">Note</span> (<code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">N</span></code>) to mark it, too.</li>
<li>Connect the <span class="guilabel">Lever</span> to the <span class="guilabel">Floodgates</span>. Hit
<code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">q</span></code>, place the cursor on the <span class="guilabel">Lever</span>, <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">f</span></code>, and
select one of the floodgates you placed, using any old mechanisms.
Then hit <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">q</span></code>, <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">f</span></code> again and select the other floodgate to
hook it up, too.</li>
<li>When the Mechanic finishes these jobs, test out the
<span class="guilabel">Lever</span> by queueing a <span class="guilabel">Pull the Lever</span> job
(<code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">a</span></code>, <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">P</span></code>). If both floodgates open, it`s all set up!
Close them again when you’re satisfied.</li>
</ul>
<img alt="../_images/09-8-hospital.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/09-8-hospital.png" />
<p>Next, let’s dig the water channel from the river.
Start at the river and <span class="guilabel">Channel</span> (<code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">d</span></code>, <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">h</span></code>) a
3x1 section as pictured. Make sure to leave at least one tile
intact between the river and the channel! Otherwise, the channel
will flood prematurely. When we are ready to tap the river, we will
<span class="guilabel">Channel</span> out this canal to let the water flow.</p>
<img alt="../_images/09-9-hospital.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/09-9-hospital.png" />
<ul class="simple">
<li>We need to make a ramp all the way down to the top of our cistern
at z-level -6. Remembering that each <span class="guilabel">Channel</span> job will
create a ramp on the tile below it, we move one tile south and one
z-level down for each subsequent <span class="guilabel">Channel</span> designation.</li>
</ul>
<img alt="../_images/09-10-hospital.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/09-10-hospital.png" />
<img alt="../_images/09-11-hospital.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/09-11-hospital.png" />
<img alt="../_images/09-12-hospital.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/09-12-hospital.png" />
<img alt="../_images/09-13-hospital.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/09-13-hospital.png" />
<img alt="../_images/09-14-hospital.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/09-14-hospital.png" />
<ul class="simple">
<li>At z-level -6, <span class="guilabel">Dig</span> a 3x1 tunnel south to the spillway
tunnel…</li>
</ul>
<img alt="../_images/09-15-hospital.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/09-15-hospital.png" />
<ul class="simple">
<li>then dig west until the cistern.</li>
</ul>
<img alt="../_images/09-16-hospital.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/09-16-hospital.png" />
<ul class="simple">
<li>Dig out two wall tiles at the cistern.</li>
</ul>
<img alt="../_images/09-17-hospital.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/09-17-hospital.png" />
<ul class="simple">
<li>Build <span class="guilabel">Vertical Bars</span> (<code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">b</span></code>, <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">B</span></code>) across the
water supply tunnel to keep the surface riffraff out. Although bars
can be destroyed by a building destroyer (like that
<span class="guilabel">Giant</span> from earlier), we will make sure that the bars
stay submerged and inaccessible to all but acquatic building
destroyers.</li>
<li>After the <span class="guilabel">Vertical Bars</span> are built, place three
<span class="guilabel">Floodgates</span> across the tunnel to the south of the
<span class="guilabel">Vertical Bars</span>.</li>
</ul>
<img alt="../_images/09-18-hospital.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/09-18-hospital.png" />
<ul class="simple">
<li><span class="guilabel">Dig</span> a 3x1 relief valve to connect the water supply
tunnel to the spillway tunnel. Then install <span class="guilabel">Floodgates</span>
across it. Safety first!</li>
</ul>
<img alt="../_images/09-19-hospital.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/09-19-hospital.png" />
<ul class="simple">
<li>Install the last <span class="guilabel">Floodgates</span> between the water supply
tunnel and the cistern. If dwarves get stuck behind them, move on
quickly to the next step where we install levers to open the gates.</li>
</ul>
<img alt="../_images/09-20-hospital.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/09-20-hospital.png" />
<p>Build three <span class="guilabel">Levers</span> (<code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">b</span></code>, <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">T</span></code>, <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">l</span></code>) to
control the three sets of floodgates. It`s important to keep track
of which lever controls which floodgate, so I like to build a mini
facsimile of the tunnel network and place the levers where the
floodgates are located. It`s also a great idea to put a
<span class="guilabel">Note</span> on each lever (<code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">N</span></code>, <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">p</span></code>) and name it
with <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">n</span></code> so you don`t forget. Here is the scheme that I came
up with:</p>
<img alt="../_images/09-21-hospital.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/09-21-hospital.png" />
<ul class="simple">
<li>Hook up each <span class="guilabel">lever</span> to the cooresponding set of
<span class="guilabel">floodgates</span>. Select the correct <span class="guilabel">floodgate</span>
with <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">+</span></code>/<code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">-</span></code> and use any old mechanisms.</li>
<li>Test out the levers after they are hooked up to ensure that each
one operates the appropriate set of floodgates.</li>
<li>Stick a door on the entrance to your lever room in order to
further floodproof it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Floodgates can become stuck open if debris like boulders block
their tile when open, and moving water tends to push boulders under
open floodgates. This floods the fortress. Therefore, we must
remove all boulders from our waterworks.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Hit <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">i</span></code>, designate a 1x1 zone somewhere outside the
waterworks, and hit <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">d</span></code> to make it a <span class="guilabel">Garbage Dump</span>.</li>
<li>Hit <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">d</span></code>, <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">b</span></code>, <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">d</span></code> to enable <span class="guilabel">Dump Items</span>
designation. Designate all stone in the water supply tunnel and
spillway tunnel to be dumped. Our workforce should be large enough
by this point to get the job done relatively quickly.</li>
</ul>
<p>It`s time to remove the dike between the river and the water
channel, but it`s a good idea to take some precautions when doing
so because dwarves tend to path through fast-moving water and get
swept away. We`d like to keep our Legendary +5 Miners alive despite
their idiocy.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Ensure all floodgates are closed.</li>
<li>Hit :kbd`d`, :kbd`o`, :kbd`r` and designate a
<span class="guilabel">Restricted Traffic Area</span> encompassing the dike and the
ditch. This will make dwarves prefer any route other than over the
designated area and hopefully clue them in that walking over it
means certain death.</li>
</ul>
<img alt="../_images/09-22-hospital.gif" class="align-center" src="../_images/09-22-hospital.gif" />
<ul class="simple">
<li><span class="guilabel">Channel</span> out (<code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">d</span></code>, <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">h</span></code>) the middle tile of
the dike at the river. Then, <span class="guilabel">Channel</span> out the outer two
tiles.</li>
<li>If anyone drowns, build them a <span class="guilabel">rock Slab</span> at a mason’s
workshop and have a Craftsdwarf <span class="guilabel">Engrave Memorial Slab</span>.
Then place it next to the river so the idiot`s family will know why
he died. Disregard any dead bodies in the water supply.</li>
</ul>
<p>We now have <span class="guilabel">Water [7/7]</span> from the river held back by the
water supply tunnel floodgates at the bottom of the ramp we dug.
That means that everything above that point is completely submerged
by water. Therefore, if we opened both the water supply tunnel
floodgates and the cistern floodgates at this point, the water
pressure would push water all the way back up to z-level -1 - the
level of the river. Consequently, we must ensure that at no point
is the cistern opened directly to the river.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Ensure all floodgates are closed.</li>
<li>Open the water supply tunnel floodgates at the base of the ramp
and allow the water to fill the entire water supply tunnel.</li>
<li>When the water has reached <span class="guilabel">[7/7]</span> for most of the
water supply tunnel, close the water supply tunnel floodgates.</li>
<li>Confirm that the water supply tunnel floodgates at the base of
the ramp are closed, then open the cistern floodgates.</li>
<li>Allow the cistern to fill. Due to our design, the cistern will
not flood so long as the floodgates leading to the river remain
closed. There`s nothing to do but wait!</li>
<li>While the cistern is filling up, hit <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">b</span></code>, <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">l</span></code> to build
a <span class="guilabel">Well</span> on the open space above the cistern. Use the
highest-quality materials available because dwarves get happy
thoughts when they use a well-put-together well.</li>
<li>When the well is complete, hit <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">i</span></code>, designate a 3x3 zone in
the well room, and hit <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">w</span></code> to make it a water source.</li>
<li>If you feel like enhancing the nanny state of your fortess, you
can put some <span class="guilabel">Horizontal Bars</span> over the river water
intake ramps at z-level 0 and a <span class="guilabel">Hatch</span> over the well
access stairs. Forbidding the <span class="guilabel">Hatch</span> will at least keep
the dwarves from drowning themselves at that location.</li>
</ul>
<p>The cistern is filling nicely.</p>
<img alt="../_images/09-23-hospital.gif" class="align-center" src="../_images/09-23-hospital.gif" />
<ul class="simple">
<li>Check the water level the top level of the cistern (one z-level
below the well room) using <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">k</span></code>. When it is at
<span class="guilabel">[7/7]</span> or <span class="guilabel">[6/7]</span>, close the cistern
floodgates. If it stabilizes before reaching at least
<span class="guilabel">[6/7]</span>, close the cistern gates, refill the water supply
tunnel, seal it from the river, and reopen the cistern gates.</li>
<li>At this point we could leave the cistern floodgates open
indefinately. So long as the water supply floodgates are closed to
the river, the cistern will not overflow.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the (extremely likely) event that something goes wrong and the
fortress begins flooding, take immediate action to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><span class="guilabel">Forbid</span> and <span class="guilabel">Keep Tightly Closed</span> (<code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">q</span></code>,
<code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">l</span></code>, <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">o</span></code>) the door to your lever room and all doors
leading to the flooding area. Doors are watertight so long as they
stay shut.</li>
<li>Open all floodgates to your spillway. Use <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">a</span></code>, <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">P</span></code>,
<code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">n</span></code> on the <span class="guilabel">Levers</span> for maximum haste.</li>
<li>Close all other floodgates.</li>
<li>If things are particularly dire, extend your central staircase
downward until you hit the caverns. The water will tend to flow
down your staircase and into the caverns where there is usually
enough room for it to dissipate. That may buy you enough time to
dig a permanent spillway or seal off the flooded parts of the
fortress, but it also opens yourself to visits from uninvited guests.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our last task is to staff our new hospital. We need to appoint a
<span class="guilabel">chief medical dwarf</span> so that patients get timely care.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Hit <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">n</span></code> to bring up the <span class="guilabel">Nobles</span> panel. Scroll

<p>And welcome to the end of the tutorial! By now you should be able
to play the game on your own.  You can also check out the tutorials
in the <a class="reference internal" href="../index.html#index"><span class="std std-ref">index</span></a>, for short chapters that cover a particular topic.</p>
<p>You might consider a mega project like an enormous tower, a
castle, or a fortress entirely surrounded by magma. There are many
options, and just surviving the increasingly severe raids from
goblins and other critters can be a challenge.</p>
<p>You’re also ready to upgrade to the <a class="reference external" href="http://dffd.bay12games.com/file.php?id=7622">Starter Pack</a>,
and explore the wider world of DF addons.  From alternative graphics
to advanced tools or a real 3D visualiser… the world is your oyster!</p>
