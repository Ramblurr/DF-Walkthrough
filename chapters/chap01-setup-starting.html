<p>Dwarf Fortress is an extremely interesting and complex game, but one
which people find exceptionally difficult to get into. Although it
isn’t hard to find tutorials, many assume some basic knowledge of the
interface and what the player is looking at. They also don’t take into
account different tilesets and versions and the difficulty new users
have in finding a good site for that first fortress.</p>
<p>But all that is in the past Dwarf Fortress Walkthrough! It comes with a
pre-made world and save and full game download for you to play along
with. And a ton of screenshots. Yes, many, many screenshots.</p>
<p>So grab a drink, get your thinking cap on and be prepared for some
dwarfy fun! And carp. Never forget the carp…</p>
<div class="section" id="set-up">
<h2>1.1. Set Up<a class="headerlink" href="#set-up" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://dffd.bay12games.com/file.php?id=11171">Download the walkthrough pack here.</a></p>
<p>This tutorial uses a pre-configured install of DF, with the same
save and all the extras you need - but no more.  If that’s not
going to work for you, see the guide to <a class="reference internal" href="../misc/setting-up.html#setting-up-df"><span class="std std-ref">Setting up your install</span></a>.</p>
<p>After downloading the pack, you need to unzip the folder onto your hard
drive (but <em>not</em> in <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Program</span> <span class="pre">Files</span></code>). Then create a shortcut on your
desktop leading to the launcher or directly to <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Dwarf</span> <span class="pre">Fortress.exe</span></code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="run-the-game">
<h2>1.2. Run the Game<a class="headerlink" href="#run-the-game" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Now we’re ready to get going! Click on your new shortcut, hit “Play” if
you’re using the launcher, and you should get the screen below.</p>
<img alt="../_images/01-start-screen.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/01-start-screen.png" />
<p>So, you’ve got the game running and enjoyed the exciting ASCII intro
movie. Well done! I can tell you’ll go far! Next step is to hit
<code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">Enter</span></code> on <span class="guilabel">Continue Playing</span>, which should be
highlighted. You’ll then be presented with this screen.</p>
<img alt="../_images/01-save-list.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/01-save-list.png" />
<p>This is the save game list, which gets cluttered very quickly as
seasonal saves build up. But for now all you have to do is use the
down-arrow key (not the number pad arrow key) to select
<span class="guilabel">region1-post-embark</span>. Hit <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">Enter</span></code> and the game will load.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="first-look">
<h2>1.3. First Look<a class="headerlink" href="#first-look" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Once the game loads you will be presented with this screen. Although
it’s confusing on first glance, don’t panic! It will all be made clear
shortly. First thing though, hit <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">Space</span></code> to pause the game.
<code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">Esc</span></code> backs out of any menu you’re currently in.</p>
<img alt="../_images/01-local-area.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/01-local-area.png" />
<p>Lets talk about what you can see. First up, the screen is divided into
three sections: The left shows the local view. The center shows the
action menu, the right shows the area map. To make things a lot neater
hit <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">Tab</span></code>, which cycles through various menu arrangements. Stop
when your view matches the one below.</p>
<img alt="../_images/01-narrow-menu.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/01-narrow-menu.png" />
<p>Now we’re really cooking with gas! Soon you’ll be melting foes with
magma-falls, and drowning goblins in artfully engineered traps! But
before then, lets look around. Use the arrow keys to navigate around
the local area. You’ll notice the we’ve got a decent amount of space to
work with.</p>
<p>While you examine your surroundings you should be able to spot tree
trunks and the grassy areas easy enough, same with (frozen) ponds and
the stream and bushes. Other tiles won’t make much sense, these tend to
be the slightly-arcane zones like open air spaces (pale blue tiles, or
tiles with dots) and the earth (brown tiles) and slope or ramp tiles (upward
triangles). The screenshot below should help point those features out.</p>
<img alt="../_images/01-features-lvl108.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/01-features-lvl108.png" />
<p>Key to understanding DF’s local view is getting your head around the
fact that DF is a 3D game displayed on a 2D map. To display a variety
of heights the world is sliced into dozens of Z-levels. Each Z-level is
numbered.</p>
<p>If you look on the bottom right of the window you’ll see we’re
currently at level 108. To move between levels you need to hit <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;</span></code>
to go up, and <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">&gt;</span></code> to go down. If you go up a level the map will
look like image below. Try it yourself now.</p>
<img alt="../_images/01-features-lvl109.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/01-features-lvl109.png" />
<p>You’ll see that what was black dirt is now grass and trees. It’s like
we’ve gone up a floor in a lift and we’re no longer looking at a slope,
now we’re looking across a grassy plain. Below us is open space and
tree tops. Make sense? Now, try going back down to 108 and then down to
107, a level below “ground” level.</p>
<img alt="../_images/01-features-lvl107.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/01-features-lvl107.png" />
<p>Your view should look something like this. We’re underground now with
mostly dirt around and earth between the pool, the tree roots, and the
rest of the ground. You may have noticed the pool doesn’t appear to
have changed much, but don’t be confused. The difference is that on
this lower level we’re on the same level as the body of the pool
itself, at the level above, we’re actually above the pool a little
looking at the top of it.</p>
<p>Continue having a look around. When you’re done, return to Z-level 108
and find the wagon with our dwarves. The helpful graphic below explains
what you’re looking at.</p>
<img alt="../_images/01-unit-detail.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/01-unit-detail.png" />
</div>
<div class="section" id="lets-get-digging">
<h2>1.4. Lets get digging!<a class="headerlink" href="#lets-get-digging" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>So now what do we do? In Dwarf Fortress we’re usually trying to get a
bustling community of dozens of dwarves up and running, while fending
off goblins, the whims of nobles and assorted other evils. To do this
we need to build ourselves a mighty fortress! Preferably underground.
So lets find a cliff face to dig into and get this show on the road!</p>
<p>If you go west (left) from where our dwarves are (using the arrow keys)
you’ll see a nice cliff face. Lets dig an entrance into this spot and
plan to eventually dig down way underground where it’s safe and cosy.
First up, get the map centered around about where we want to dig (shown
on the screenshot below). Once you’re ready:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Hit the <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">d</span></code> key. You’ll see the menu on the right changes and in
the local view a yellow <span class="guilabel">X</span> has appeared. The menu on the
right should show the <span class="guilabel">Mine</span> option highlighted. If it
doesn’t, hit <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">d</span></code> again, to select it.</li>
<li>Move the cursor to the edge of the cliff, like this:</li>
</ul>
<img alt="../_images/01-dig-cursor.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/01-dig-cursor.png" />
<ul class="simple">
<li>Now hit enter and move your cursor down with the arrow keys. You’ll
see that you’ve dropped a flashing “anchor”. This is going to mark out
what your dwarves will dig. Move it across 20 and up 3 and hit
<code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">enter</span></code>, your screen should look like this:</li>
</ul>
<img alt="../_images/01-dig-hallway.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/01-dig-hallway.png" />
<p>The browned out area shows where your miners are going to come along
and dig. But they won’t act until you back out of the
<span class="guilabel">Designations</span> menu as the game is paused. Hit <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">Esc</span></code> and
you should see the game unpause and the menu reset to its master list.
Oh, when you have the <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">d</span></code> menu up you can actually click on the
map with your mouse and select areas to mine. Some people prefer to
select areas this way.</p>
<p>With the game unpaused you should notice two dwarves race to the cliff
face and start digging. With our entrance under way we should also
think about laying out some rooms for our dwarves to live in, who wants
to spend time out under that hot yellow disk when lovely rock and earth
beckon!</p>
<p>Right now we’re not worried about making our fortress perfect and
creating the strongest entrance, we’re simply trying to scratch out a
space to live! To that end we’ll need three or four rooms off this main
entrance.</p>
<p>See if you can match the layout below by marking out areas to dig, as
you’ve learnt. If you make a mistake you can hit <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">x</span></code> from the
<span class="guilabel">Designations</span> (<code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">d</span></code>) menu and you’ll note that the menu
on the right has <span class="guilabel">Remove Designation</span> highlighted. Now when
you hit enter and select an area, any area set for digging will be
cleared of that designation. Anyway, enough detail, on with the room
building!</p>
<img alt="../_images/01-dig-rooms.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/01-dig-rooms.png" />
<p>Look at the little dwarves go! Aren’t they industrious! They’re quickly
digging away and leaving a lot of dirt floor behind them. Good lads!
Lets leave them to their work while we sort out some other important
jobs.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="chopping-trees-setting-up-piles">
<h2>1.5. Chopping trees, setting up piles<a class="headerlink" href="#chopping-trees-setting-up-piles" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Dirt and rocks are handy, but so is wood to make nice dwarven beds, and
we’re short on it right now. To get wood, we need to chop down some
trees. And we do that by designating an area of trees to be chopped.
Lets get cracking and clear the trees in front of the entrance.</p>
<p>Designating trees to chop is like designating rocks to be dug, so lets
decimate the local environment!</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Move the map around so you’re looking out front of your fortress.</li>
<li>Hit <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">d</span></code>. Hopefully this time you’ll notice the game has
automatically got <span class="guilabel">Chop Down Trees</span> selected, if it doesn’t,
hit <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">t</span></code> and it will be highlighted.</li>
<li>Move the cursor to the upper left, hit <span class="guilabel">Enter</span>, and move
the cursor to the bottom right, hit <span class="guilabel">Enter</span> again. Any trees
in that area will now be set to be cut, as indicated by them all being
marked brown.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although you’ve done well neither man nor dwarf can live on wood and
dirt alone! Luckily for us there are plenty of bushes out there loaded
with ripe berries. Lets set some of them to be picked:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Hit <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">d</span></code> again and then <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">p</span></code>. One the right <span class="guilabel">Gather
Plants</span> is now selected.</li>
<li>Designate about the same area as we did with the wood cutting.</li>
<li>All the bushes will be highlighted now, and when you unpause you
should see a plant harvesting dwarf join the woodcutter.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your view now should look something like this, note the brown
‘highlights’ and fallen logs:</p>
<img alt="../_images/01-plants.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/01-plants.png" />
<p>Now lets sit back and watch the dwarves work for a minute! It won’t
take long before our miners have cleared out our temporary living
quarters and our woodcutter and plant gatherer have begun their work.
Once the interior space is clear we have lots of work to do, so lets
break it down into useful chunks.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="our-first-farm">
<h2>1.6. Our First Farm<a class="headerlink" href="#our-first-farm" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Farming is how you will make most of your food in Dwarf Fortress, and
it’s important to get farming quite quickly. If food runs out your
dwarves will starve and your game will end prematurely, and we don’t
want that, right? dwarves usually farm underground and handily, we have
a space all prepared. So follow along, and lets get some tasty
mushrooms growing for our stumpys to chow down on!</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Find the bottom right room.</li>
<li>Hit <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">b</span></code> for the <span class="guilabel">Building</span> menu and then <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">p</span></code> for
<span class="guilabel">Farm Plot</span>.</li>
<li>Move the cursor to your farm area.</li>
<li>The screen instructions tell you how you can increase the size, we
need a good 6 by 6 plot, so hit <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">u</span></code> and <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">k</span></code> a few times until
you’ve got a big green grid, like the one below.</li>
<li>Move the grid around with the arrow keys until it’s in about the same
position as the one in the screenshot. If you get the size wrong,
<code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">h</span></code> and <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">m</span></code> will reduce the plot.</li>
</ul>
<img alt="../_images/01-farm-plot.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/01-farm-plot.png" />
<ul class="simple">
<li>Hit <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">Enter</span></code> and the green area marker will change to a flashing
brown field marker. When stuff flashes it indicates that dwarves are on
their way to come build the construction, in this case, a field. And
lookee-here! A farmer has come to build our field for us!</li>
</ul>
<img alt="../_images/01-farm-build.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/01-farm-build.png" />
<p>He will take a short while to build your field. When you see the dwarf
run off, you know he’s done. Now it’s time to set the field to grow
delicious plump helmets all year round.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Hit the <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">q</span></code> key. This is the key for <span class="guilabel">Set Building
Tasks and Preferences</span>. Again you’ll notice a cursor on the local
screen and if it’s anywhere near the field, the field will be flashing.
You can move that cursor around with your arrow keys, this is useful
later on when you need to select different workshops and buildings.</li>
<li>You’ll note that on the right the menu now shows you specific task
details associated with that field, like so:</li>
</ul>
<img alt="../_images/01-crop-select.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/01-crop-select.png" />
<ul class="simple">
<li>What we want to do is set <span class="guilabel">Plump helmets</span> as the food to be
planted every season. You can see on the top right of the menu we have
the various plants we could try and grow and in the middle area we have
the different seasons. Right now <span class="guilabel">Dimple cups</span> are selected
(but not highlighted, note) and the season is set on
<span class="guilabel">Spring</span>, as it’s Spring currently. We need to change these
settings.</li>
<li>Now comes an important skill! Menu scrolling! Using <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">=</span></code> (<em>not</em>
the down-arrow), scroll down through the list to <span class="guilabel">Plump
helmets</span> and hit enter.  You should now see <span class="guilabel">Plump helmets</span>
highlighted. By the way, <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">-</span></code>/<code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">=</span></code> is the way to scroll in
menus; DF usually uses - and +, but having to use the shift key gets
annoying.</li>
<li>Good work! But right now we’ve only set the spring planting. It’s
time to set the planting for Summer, Winter and Autumn too. To do this,
with the field task menu up, hit <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">b</span></code> for Summer and then scroll to
<span class="guilabel">Plump helmets</span> and hit enter again. Hit <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">c</span></code> for Autumn,
set <span class="guilabel">Plump helmets</span> and then <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">d</span></code> for Winter, repeating
your selection. You may have noticed that what you can plant changes
with the seasons, but don’t worry about that for now.</li>
<li>Hit <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">Esc</span></code> to back out of the menu and resume the game. Your
dwarves will quickly begin planting in your new field, well done!</li>
</ul>
<p>Now we’ve got a field down hopefully none of your dwarves will starve,
go crazy and resort to eating rats, or each other. Pretty soon you’ll
have a few seeds in the ground and your farm will begin to look a bit
like this:</p>
<img alt="../_images/01-crop-planting.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/01-crop-planting.png" />
<p>Oh, by now you may have noticed the announcements along the bottom of
the screen. This is generally because the game wants to let you know
that something important has happened. You can hit space to let the
game resume, or hit <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">a</span></code> to see the alert if you miss it at the
bottom of the screen). Hitting <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">Esc</span></code> will take you back out of the
alerts menu and resume the game.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="stockpiles">
<h2>1.7. Stockpiles<a class="headerlink" href="#stockpiles" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>While you can just leave all of your dwarves’ stuff strewn around the
countryside, it’s much more efficient to have it all inside near where
it’s needed. You may have noticed your farmer dwarves running in and
out of the fortress to grab the seeds that they need (when they flash
between their icon and a little red dot (the seed icon) you know they
are carrying seeds).</p>
<p>This is where stockpiles come in. They make everything more organised.
A stockpile for all our food and seeds right next door to the farm
would probably be pretty handy, right? We don’t want the dwarves
running across the map to get a bite to eat or a seed to plant, so lets
make a food stockpile inside!</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Find the room opposite the farm.</li>
<li>Hit the <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">p</span></code> key (for “piles” of course), a cursor will appear.</li>
<li>Hit <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">f</span></code> to select <span class="guilabel">Food</span>, we want to make a food
stockpile, after all.</li>
<li>Move the cursor to the bottom right of the room, hit enter, move it
to the top center and hit enter again. You have now set that space as a
food stockpile, well done!</li>
<li>Hit <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">w</span></code> to make a <span class="guilabel">Wood</span> stockpile, and place it on
the other side of the room.</li>
<li>After a few seconds your spare dwarves will start moving food inside,
you’ll see barrels and bags being hauled and pretty soon the stockpile
will look something like this:</li>
</ul>
<img alt="../_images/01-first-stockpiles.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/01-first-stockpiles.png" />
<p>You don’t have much room inside the fortress yet, so no more piles for
now. In time you’re going to want to put stockpiles everywhere to help
manage your production and resource gathering. For now, well done,
you’ve got food production up and running, you’ve set up a stockpile,
you’ve set wood to be chopped and plants to be gathered and you know
how to do some basic digging! You’ve come far!</p>
<p>Before reading Chapter 2, how about setting some more plants to be gathered
and more wood to be chopped. Then, head <a class="reference internal" href="chap02-workshops-digging.html#chapter02"><span class="std std-ref">to the next instalment</span></a>
and we’ll learn all about workshops, bedrooms, dinning rooms and stairs! It
will be ever so exciting, I promise!</p>
